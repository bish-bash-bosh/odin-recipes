    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The classic: german pork schnitzel - a easy to make, timeless dish for all of the meat lovers.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs boneless pork chops</li>
        <li>1/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tbsp garlic salt (or sub with equal parts salt and garlic powder)</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp black pepper, freshly ground</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 cups bread crumbs</li>
        <li>olive oil, canola oil or any other heat cooking oil to saute</li>
        <li>lemon wedges to serve</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice pork chops into 1/2"-thick cutlets. Line a cutting board with plastic wrap,
            place cutlets in a single layer on cutting board and cover with plastic wrap (prevents
            splatter). Pound cutlets with a meat mallet or the back of a heave saucepan, until
            1/4" to 1/8" thick.</li>
            <br>
        <li>Set up three bowls. In the first combine 1/3 cup flour, 1 Tbps garlic salt, 
            1/2 tps paprika and 1/2 tsp pepper. In the second, use a fork to beat 3 eggs.
            In the third bowl, add 2 cups breadcrumbs.</li>
            <br>
        <li>Dredge both sides of each pounded cutlet in flour then dip in beaten egg letting 
            excess egg drip back into the bowl before breading in crumbs. It helps to use a 
            fork for the dipping process to keep your hands clean. Repeat with remaining cutlets.</li>
            <br>
        <li>Once all cutlets are breaded, heat a large non-stick pan over medium heat and 
            add enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan. Once oil is hot, add breaded cutlets 
            a few at a time and sauté 3-4 minutes per side or until cooked through. Reduce heat 
            if cutlets are browning too quickly. Remove to a paper towel lined plate. Cut into 
            one to double check doneness – juices should run clear. Serve right away with lemon wedges</li>        
    </ol>
